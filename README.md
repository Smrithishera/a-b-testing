# A/B Testing using Python
A/B Testing is one of the most important aspects in Marketing.
It is used to find the best method of marketing between two businesses

The dataset we are using here contains two data files about two marketing campaigns - **Control Campaign and Test Campaign **

# RESULT

- From the A/B test conducted, we are able to find that the control campaign resulted in more sales and engagement from the visitors.
- More products were viewed from the control campaign, resulting in more products in the cart and more sales.
- But the conversation rate of products in the cart is higher in the test campaign. The test campaign resulted in more sales according to the products viewed and added to the cart.
- And the control campaign results in more sales overall.
- So, the Test campaign can be used to market a specific product to a specific audience, and the Control campaign can be used to market multiple products to a wider audience.
